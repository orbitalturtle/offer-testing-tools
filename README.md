This repository houses a couple little tools and instructions for setting up test networks with the aim of testing paying offers using LNDK to CLN, Eclair, and LDK.

Setting up test networks manually is pretty annoying and time-consuming, so we use Polar and scripts for setup (where we can).

It's a mess. But I figured I'd post it to github in case others eventually find these tools and instructions useful.
